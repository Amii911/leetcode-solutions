'''
from two arry return the elements that are similar in both, no duplicates

i = 1[1,2,3,4] 2[1,2,2,3,6]
o = [1,2,3]

i = 1[2,3,4,5] 2[9,8,7,6]
o = []

does ordering matter? no?
cant have repeated elements in output?

brute force? looping through both arrays and adding to result=[] any repeated elements. but how to make sure none are repeated?
        l=[]
        for i in range(len(nums1)):
            for j in range(len(nums2)):
                if nums1[i]==nums2[j] and nums1[i] not in l:
                    l.append(nums1[i])
        return(l)

two pointers? one pointing at first arr and comparing to second array to compare

hash set? keeping track of what in arr 1 and arr2, able to keep unique
