return the max amount of profit you can achieve. you can achieve this by choosing a day to buy and a diff day to sell.

i = [1,2,3,4]
o = buy on 0:1 and sell on 3:4 reutnr 3

i = [2,2,2,2]
o = 0

can i re order array? pick arr[0] sell on arr[-1]

brute force? looping through the whole arr to see that smallest num is before the highest num in the array
        max_profit = 0

        for i in range(len(prices)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(prices)):
                curr_profit = prices[j] - prices[i]
                if curr_profit > max_profit:
                    max_profit = curr_profit
        return max_profit

two pointers? having a point on one day and another point on another day 
l = buy
r = sell

storing max_profit = storing when the diff between l & r 
time = O(n)
space = O(1)
