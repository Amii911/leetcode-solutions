'''
reutrn the middle of the linked list
if the list even return the second link in the list 

if odd - reutrn middle
if even - return the second of the two in the middle

are we returning an array?

i --> 1-2-3-4 
o --> 3-4

i --> 1-2-3
o --> 2

-- need to locate the middle link so maybe two pointers? 
-- fast , slow? 
-- need to loop through link.. 
    fast will go every two and slow going one.

approach:
turn ll into an array time O(n) space O(n) (creating an arr)
        nodes = []

        node = head
        while node:
            nodes.append(node)
            node = node.next

        return nodes[len(nodes) // 2]

recrusive time O(n) space
        def getLen(head):
            length = 0
            while head:
                length += 1
                head = head.next
            return length 

        def getNode(head, steps):
            if steps == 0:
                return head
            return getNode(head.next, steps - 1)
        
        length = getLen(head)
        return getNode(head, length // 2)
*when moving from iterative to recrusive you cant have a while loop

iterative time O(n) space
        def getLen(head):
            length = 0
            while head:
                length += 1
                head = head.next
            return length 

        def getNode(head, steps):
            while steps > 0:
                head = head.next
                steps -= 1
            return head
            
        length = getLen(head)
        return getNode(head, length // 2)
